# 3-column page design

This is a little page that has a simple 3 column desing. It is part of a challenge I did from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) and I was very satisfied with the result. This is the design that I had to make as similar as posible:

This is my 2nd HTML and CSS project, I hope to keep it going like this.

IÂ´m planning to add some JS functions to make it more interesting.
